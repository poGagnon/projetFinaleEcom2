                    Hockey is an American sport that originated as a game played between teams of four
                    players on ice. It was developed by Canadians who wanted to create their own version

                    Golf, also known as golfer, is a family of handball games based around
                    putting balls into holes designed to be hit with stones. In most countries, there's
                    only one type of hole — called tee—and each player has his/her own ball.</p>
